      "{'question': \"What was NVIDIA's revenue in 2024 and 2023? Which year saw higher revenues and by how much?\"}\n",
      "{'answer': \"Revenue in 2024 was $60,922 million ($60.9 billion) , revenue in 2023 was $26,974 million ($27.0 billion). NVIDIA's revenue increased by $33,948 million (or $33.95 billion depending on the rounding) in 2024 compared to 2023.\"}\n",
      "{'question': 'Between January 29, 2023, and January 28, 2024, NVIDIA’s total assets increased by approximately $24.5 billion. Based on the balance sheet, which two line items contributed the most to this increase, and what does this suggest about the company’s capital deployment focus?'}\n",
      "{'answer': 'Between January 29, 2023, and January 28, 2024, NVIDIA’s total assets increased by approximately $24.5 billion, rising from $41.2 billion to $65.7 billion. Based on the balance sheet, the two line items that contributed the most to this increase were marketable securities, which increased from $9.9 billion to $18.7 billion, and cash and cash equivalents, which increased from $3.4 billion to $7.3 billion. Together, these two line items account for approximately $13.7 billion of the total asset increase. This suggests that NVIDIA’s capital deployment focus emphasized preserving liquidity and flexibility, likely to ensure the company maintains ample financial resources for future strategic opportunities, such as potential acquisitions, research and development investments, or shareholder returns. The strong growth in these liquid assets highlights a preference for maintaining a robust financial position, possibly in response to the dynamic technology landscape and potential geopolitical or economic uncertainties.\\n'}\n",
      "{'question': \"In fiscal year 2024, NVIDIA generated a substantial increase in operating cash flow compared to fiscal year 2023. However, despite this cash inflow, the company's cash balance at year-end only increased modestly. Analyze the main drivers behind this modest cash increase and discuss what this reveals about NVIDIA’s capital allocation priorities and potential financial strategy.\"}\n",
      "{'answer': \"In fiscal year 2024, NVIDIA generated a substantial increase in operating cash flow compared to fiscal year 2023. However, despite this cash inflow, the company's cash balance at year-end only increased modestly. Net cash provided by operating activities increased from $5.6 billion in FY23 to $28.1 billion in FY24 — an increase of over $22 billion. This massive improvement reflects the sharp rise in net income (from $4.4 billion to $29.8 billion), combined with adjustments like $3.5 billion in stock-based compensation and favorable working capital movements (notably accounts payable and accrued liabilities). Despite this influx, NVIDIA’s cash balance only increased from $3.39 billion to $7.28 billion — a $3.89 billion increase. This is modest compared to the $28.1 billion operating cash inflow. $18.2 billion was spent on marketable securities purchases, exceeding maturities and sales (combined inflow of just $9.78 billion). $9.53 billion was spent on stock repurchases, showing NVIDIA’s continued focus on returning capital to shareholders. $2.78 billion was used for tax payments on restricted stock units, another shareholder-related cash outflow. $395 million was paid in dividends. $1.07 billion was spent on capital expenditures. NVIDIA prioritized reinvesting cash into marketable securities, perhaps to preserve flexibility for future strategic opportunities (acquisitions, R&D expansion, etc.). The second major priority was shareholder returns, particularly through aggressive share repurchases and some dividend payments. Capital expenditures were relatively modest compared to the overall cash generation, suggesting that NVIDIA’s core business currently operates with low capital intensity — typical for a fabless semiconductor firm. The combination of aggressive buybacks, tax payments on equity compensation, and heavy marketable securities investment reveals NVIDIA’s financial strategy: balancing short-term shareholder returns with maintaining long-term flexibility for future opportunities. This pattern also highlights that a large portion of the company’s excess cash flow was effectively parked, rather than directly deployed into operating or capital investments\\n\"}\n",
      "{'question': \"How does the conflict in Israel effect NVIDIA's business? How many people are affected? What proportion is that relative to NVIDIA's complete workforce?\"}\n",
      "{'answer': 'The conflict in Israel affects NVIDIA’s business by impacting the health and safety of approximately 3,700 employees in the region, who are primarily involved in research and development, operations, and sales and marketing of NVIDIA’s networking products. While NVIDIA’s global supply chain for networking products has not experienced significant impacts, a substantial number of employees in Israel have been called up for active military duty, which has caused and could continue to cause some disruption to product development and operations. NVIDIA’s operating expenses for fiscal year 2024 include costs related to financial support for impacted employees and charitable activity. Although there was no significant impact on business operations or expenses in fiscal year 2024, NVIDIA acknowledges that a prolonged or escalated conflict could impact future product development, operations, revenue, or create other uncertainties for the business.\\nOut of NVIDIA’s approximately 29,600 employees globally at the end of fiscal year 2024, the 3,700 employees in Israel represent roughly 12.5% of the total workforce.\\n'}\n",

      "{'answer': 'The executive officer who joined NVIDIA most recently is Timothy S. Teter, who joined NVIDIA in 2017 as Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, and became Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretaryin February 2018.'}\n",
      "{'question': 'What types of costs does NVIDIA have, and how have these costs changed over time as a percentage of revenue?'}\n",
      "{'answer': \"NVIDIA's costs can be categorized into the following types: cost of revenue, research and development, sales, general and administrative, and in 2023, there was an acquisition termination cost. To assess how these costs have changed over time as a percentage of revenue, the following calculations apply.\\nCost of revenue as a percentage of revenue in 2024 is calculated as 16,621 divided by 60,922, which equals approximately 27.3%. In 2023, it is 11,618 divided by 26,974, equaling approximately 43.1%. In 2022, it is 9,439 divided by 26,914, equaling approximately 35.1%.\\nResearch and development as a percentage of revenue in 2024 is calculated as 8,675 divided by 60,922, which equals approximately 14.2%. In 2023, it is 7,339 divided by 26,974, equaling approximately 27.2%. In 2022, it is 5,268 divided by 26,914, equaling approximately 19.6%.\\nSales, general and administrative as a percentage of revenue in 2024 is calculated as 2,654 divided by 60,922, which equals approximately 4.4%. In 2023, it is 2,440 divided by 26,974, equaling approximately 9.0%. In 2022, it is 2,166 divided by 26,914, equaling approximately 8.0%.\\nThe acquisition termination cost only occurred in 2023 and as a percentage of revenue is calculated as 1,353 divided by 26,974, equaling approximately 5.0%.\\nOver time, cost of revenue has decreased significantly as a percentage of revenue, from about 35.1% in 2022 to 27.3% in 2024, showing improved gross margin. Research and development costs also declined as a percentage of revenue from 27.2% in 2023 to 14.2% in 2024, though they rose slightly in absolute terms. Sales, general and administrative expenses shrank as a percentage of revenue from 9.0% in 2023 to 4.4% in 2024. In 2023, there was a one-time acquisition termination cost, which was 5.0% of revenue, but this was absent in 2024 and 2022. Overall, NVIDIA’s costs as a proportion of revenue have decreased across all major categories, indicating improved efficiency and profitability in 2024.\\n\"}\n",
      "{'question': 'What is the lifestory of NVIDIA’s CFO, was he/she already at the firm when the Arm Acquisition was terminated?'}\n",
      "{'answer': 'Colette M. Kress joined NVIDIA in 2013 as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, meaning she was already at the firm when the Arm acquisition was terminated in February 2022.
