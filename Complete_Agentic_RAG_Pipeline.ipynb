    "# Agentic RAG System\n",
    "This notebook implements a fully agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow for answering complex questions grounded in documents such as NVIDIA's 10-K filings. It combines LangChain’s composable chains and retrievers with LangSmith’s tracing and evaluation capabilities to build, inspect, and optimize the system end to end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overview of Features:\n",
    "- **Question Rewriting**: Reformulates user questions into more retrieval-effective queries using a language model.\n",
    "- **Context Retrieval**: Retrieves passages from both detailed and summary vector stores to ensure semantic coverage.\n",
    "- **Context Filtering**: Applies an LLM-based step to eliminate irrelevant content from retrieved documents.\n",
    "- **Answer Generation with Chain-of-Thought**: Uses structured reasoning to produce grounded, explainable answers from context.\n",
    "- **Evaluation and Quality Control**:\n",
    "    - Detects hallucinated answers via factual grounding checks.\n",
    "    - Determines whether the question can be fully answered by the retrieved context.\n",
    "    - Grades the relevance of retrieved documents to the question.\n",
    "    - Optionally compares the generated answer to reference answers using LangSmith’s evaluation suite.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a flexible and testable RAG architecture suitable for high-stakes domains such as finance, legal, and research where traceability and factual consistency are essential.\n",

      "{'question': \"What was NVIDIA's revenue in 2024 and 2023? Which year saw higher revenues and by how much?\"}\n",
      "{'answer': \"Revenue in 2024 was $60,922 million ($60.9 billion) , revenue in 2023 was $26,974 million ($27.0 billion). NVIDIA's revenue increased by $33,948 million (or $33.95 billion depending on the rounding) in 2024 compared to 2023.\"}\n",
      "{'question': 'Between January 29, 2023, and January 28, 2024, NVIDIA’s total assets increased by approximately $24.5 billion. Based on the balance sheet, which two line items contributed the most to this increase, and what does this suggest about the company’s capital deployment focus?'}\n",
      "{'answer': 'Between January 29, 2023, and January 28, 2024, NVIDIA’s total assets increased by approximately $24.5 billion, rising from $41.2 billion to $65.7 billion. Based on the balance sheet, the two line items that contributed the most to this increase were marketable securities, which increased from $9.9 billion to $18.7 billion, and cash and cash equivalents, which increased from $3.4 billion to $7.3 billion. Together, these two line items account for approximately $13.7 billion of the total asset increase. This suggests that NVIDIA’s capital deployment focus emphasized preserving liquidity and flexibility, likely to ensure the company maintains ample financial resources for future strategic opportunities, such as potential acquisitions, research and development investments, or shareholder returns. The strong growth in these liquid assets highlights a preference for maintaining a robust financial position, possibly in response to the dynamic technology landscape and potential geopolitical or economic uncertainties.\\n'}\n",
      "{'question': \"In fiscal year 2024, NVIDIA generated a substantial increase in operating cash flow compared to fiscal year 2023. However, despite this cash inflow, the company's cash balance at year-end only increased modestly. Analyze the main drivers behind this modest cash increase and discuss what this reveals about NVIDIA’s capital allocation priorities and potential financial strategy.\"}\n",
      "{'answer': \"In fiscal year 2024, NVIDIA generated a substantial increase in operating cash flow compared to fiscal year 2023. However, despite this cash inflow, the company's cash balance at year-end only increased modestly. Net cash provided by operating activities increased from $5.6 billion in FY23 to $28.1 billion in FY24 — an increase of over $22 billion. This massive improvement reflects the sharp rise in net income (from $4.4 billion to $29.8 billion), combined with adjustments like $3.5 billion in stock-based compensation and favorable working capital movements (notably accounts payable and accrued liabilities). Despite this influx, NVIDIA’s cash balance only increased from $3.39 billion to $7.28 billion — a $3.89 billion increase. This is modest compared to the $28.1 billion operating cash inflow. $18.2 billion was spent on marketable securities purchases, exceeding maturities and sales (combined inflow of just $9.78 billion). $9.53 billion was spent on stock repurchases, showing NVIDIA’s continued focus on returning capital to shareholders. $2.78 billion was used for tax payments on restricted stock units, another shareholder-related cash outflow. $395 million was paid in dividends. $1.07 billion was spent on capital expenditures. NVIDIA prioritized reinvesting cash into marketable securities, perhaps to preserve flexibility for future strategic opportunities (acquisitions, R&D expansion, etc.). The second major priority was shareholder returns, particularly through aggressive share repurchases and some dividend payments. Capital expenditures were relatively modest compared to the overall cash generation, suggesting that NVIDIA’s core business currently operates with low capital intensity — typical for a fabless semiconductor firm. The combination of aggressive buybacks, tax payments on equity compensation, and heavy marketable securities investment reveals NVIDIA’s financial strategy: balancing short-term shareholder returns with maintaining long-term flexibility for future opportunities. This pattern also highlights that a large portion of the company’s excess cash flow was effectively parked, rather than directly deployed into operating or capital investments\\n\"}\n",
      "{'question': \"How does the conflict in Israel effect NVIDIA's business? How many people are affected? What proportion is that relative to NVIDIA's complete workforce?\"}\n",
      "{'answer': 'The conflict in Israel affects NVIDIA’s business by impacting the health and safety of approximately 3,700 employees in the region, who are primarily involved in research and development, operations, and sales and marketing of NVIDIA’s networking products. While NVIDIA’s global supply chain for networking products has not experienced significant impacts, a substantial number of employees in Israel have been called up for active military duty, which has caused and could continue to cause some disruption to product development and operations. NVIDIA’s operating expenses for fiscal year 2024 include costs related to financial support for impacted employees and charitable activity. Although there was no significant impact on business operations or expenses in fiscal year 2024, NVIDIA acknowledges that a prolonged or escalated conflict could impact future product development, operations, revenue, or create other uncertainties for the business.\\nOut of NVIDIA’s approximately 29,600 employees globally at the end of fiscal year 2024, the 3,700 employees in Israel represent roughly 12.5% of the total workforce.\\n'}\n",

To assess how these costs have changed over time as a percentage of revenue, the following calculations apply.\\nCost of revenue as a percentage of revenue in 2024 is calculated as 16,621 divided by 60,922, which equals approximately 27.3%. In 2023, it is 11,618 divided by 26,974, equaling approximately 43.1%. In 2022, it is 9,439 divided by 26,914, equaling approximately 35.1%.\\nResearch and development as a percentage of revenue in 2024 is calculated as 8,675 divided by 60,922, which equals approximately 14.2%. In 2023, it is 7,339 divided by 26,974, equaling approximately 27.2%. In 2022, it is 5,268 divided by 26,914, equaling approximately 19.6%.\\nSales, general and administrative as a percentage of revenue in 2024 is calculated as 2,654 divided by 60,922, which equals approximately 4.4%. In 2023, it is 2,440 divided by 26,974, equaling approximately 9.0%. In 2022, it is 2,166 divided by 26,914, equaling approximately 8.0%.\\nThe acquisition termination cost only occurred in 2023 and as a percentage of revenue is calculated as 1,353 divided by 26,974, equaling approximately 5.0%.\\nOver time, cost of revenue has decreased significantly as a percentage of revenue, from about 35.1% in 2022 to 27.3% in 2024, showing improved gross margin. Research and development costs also declined as a percentage of revenue from 27.2% in 2023 to 14.2% in 2024, though they rose slightly in absolute terms. Sales, general and administrative expenses shrank as a percentage of revenue from 9.0% in 2023 to 4.4% in 2024. In 2023, there was a one-time acquisition termination cost, which was 5.0% of revenue, but this was absent in 2024 and 2022.

      "answer before checking hallucination: To analyze the modest increase in NVIDIA's cash balance at year-end 2024 despite a substantial increase in operating cash flow, we can break down the situation as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Operating Cash Flow Increase**: NVIDIA's cash flow from operating activities surged to $28.1 billion in fiscal year 2024, a significant increase from $5.6 billion in 2023. This increase was primarily driven by a rise in net income, which jumped from $4.4 billion to $29.8 billion, along with adjustments for stock-based compensation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Investing Activities**: Despite the strong operating cash flow, NVIDIA experienced a net cash outflow of $10.6 billion from investing activities. This outflow was mainly due to purchases of marketable securities amounting to $18.2 billion, indicating a strategic investment in financial instruments. Such investments can be seen as a way to manage excess cash and potentially earn returns, but they also reduce the cash available at year-end.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Financing Activities**: The company also had a net cash outflow of $13.6 billion from financing activities, which included significant payments related to stock repurchases and tax payments on restricted stock units. This suggests that NVIDIA is prioritizing returning value to shareholders through stock buybacks, which can enhance earnings per share but also deplete cash reserves.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Overall Cash Position**: As a result of these activities, NVIDIA's cash and cash equivalents increased to $7.3 billion by the end of 2024, up from $3.4 billion in 2023. While this is a positive increase, it is modest compared to the substantial cash inflow from operations, indicating that the company is actively using its cash for investments and shareholder returns rather than accumulating cash reserves.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Capital Allocation Priorities**: The modest increase in cash suggests that NVIDIA is focused on growth and shareholder returns rather than hoarding cash. The significant investments in marketable securities and the commitment to stock repurchases indicate a strategy aimed at enhancing shareholder value while also investing in future growth opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, NVIDIA's capital allocation priorities appear to be centered on balancing growth investments with returning capital to shareholders. The modest increase in cash reflects a strategic choice to reinvest in the business and reward shareholders rather than simply increasing cash reserves.\n",

      "answer before checking hallucination: To analyze NVIDIA's change in cash and cash equivalents compared to the change in total liabilities between fiscal year-end 2023 and 2024, we can break down the information as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Change in Cash and Cash Equivalents:**  \n",
      "   - Cash and cash equivalents at the end of fiscal year 2023: $3.389 billion  \n",
      "   - Cash and cash equivalents at the end of fiscal year 2024: $7.280 billion  \n",
      "   - Change in cash and cash equivalents = $7.280 billion - $3.389 billion = **$3.891 billion increase**.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Change in Total Liabilities:**  \n",
      "   - Total liabilities at the end of fiscal year 2023: $19.081 billion  \n",
      "   - Total liabilities at the end of fiscal year 2024: $22.750 billion  \n",
      "   - Change in total liabilities = $22.750 billion - $19.081 billion = **$3.669 billion increase**.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Comparison of Changes:**  \n",
      "   - Cash and cash equivalents increased by $3.891 billion, while total liabilities increased by $3.669 billion.\n",
      "   - This indicates that the increase in cash and cash equivalents was greater than the increase in total liabilities by **$222 million**.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Implications:**  \n",
      "   - The fact that cash and cash equivalents increased more than total liabilities suggests that NVIDIA is improving its liquidity position.  \n",
      "   - This could indicate a stronger financial health, as the company is generating more cash relative to its obligations, which may provide more flexibility for future investments, operations, and potential debt repayments.\n",
